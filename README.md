# webcam-flash
This is a very simle HTML page that can be used as a "flash" during virtual meetings, allowing you to better control the color tone of your video.

It is meant to be saved locally and does not call any external resources. The base64 bit is just the favicon, strip that out if you want a leaner version.

If you want the page to load with a color already selected, use the `color` URL parameter, eg: `/path/to/webcam-flash.html?color=MistyRose`
